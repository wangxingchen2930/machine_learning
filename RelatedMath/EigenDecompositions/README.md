# Eigen Decompositions

## Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors

Considering Av, usually Av and v will not be in the same line. But for some v, Av=(lambda)v, where lambda is a scaler. Then Av and v are in the same line. We say such v is an eigenvector and lambda is eigenvalue

- Eigenvalues are the amount that the eigenvectors are stretched by the application of the matrix.

## Eigendecompositions

- One nice thing about eigendecompositions is that we can write many operations we usually encounter cleanly in terms of the eigendecomposition
- By examining the eigendecomposition closely, we can see that the rank of square matrix A is the same as the number of non-zero eigenvalues of A.

## Application

The relationship between the eigenvalues (and a related object called singular values) of random matrices has been shown to have deep connections to proper initialization of neural networks as was discussed in and subsequent works.

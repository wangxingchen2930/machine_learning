## Taylor Series

The Taylor series provides a method to approximate the function f(x) if we are given values for the first n derivatives at a point x_0

Taylor series have two primary applications:

- Theoretical applications: Often when we try to understand a too complex function, using Taylor series enables us to turn it into a polynomial that we can work with directly.

- Numerical applications: Some functions like cos(x) are difficult for machines to compute. They can store tables of values at a fixed precision (and this is often done), but it still leaves open questions like “What is the 1000-th digit of cos(1)?” Taylor series are often helpful to answer such questions.

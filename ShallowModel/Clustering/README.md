# Clustering

## Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

GMM is a type of clustering algorithm. As its name implies, each cluster is modelled according to a different Gaussian distribution. This flexible and probabilistic approach to modelling the data means that rather than having hard assignments into clusters like k-means, we have soft assignments.

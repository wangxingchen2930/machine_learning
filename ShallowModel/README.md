## Clustering vs CLassification

Although both techniques have certain similarities, the difference lies in the fact that classification uses predefined classes in which objects are assigned, while clustering identifies similarities between objects, which it groups according to those characteristics in common and which differentiate them from other groups of objects. These groups are known as "clusters".

## PCA

PCA is an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction and data visualization technique for very high dimensional data. As having high dimensional data is very hard to gain insights from adding to that, it is very computationally intensive. The main idea behind this technique is to reduce the dimensionality of data that is highly correlated by transforming the original set of vectors to a new set which is known as Principal component.

## t-SNE

t-SNE is a unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction and data visualization technique. The math behind t-SNE is quite complex but the idea is simple. It embeds the points from a higher dimension to a lower dimension trying to preserve the neighborhood (cluster) of that point.
